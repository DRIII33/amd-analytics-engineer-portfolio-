# Analytical Framework Overview

This project applies a structured analytics framework designed to mirror real-world decision workflows:

### 1. Executive Signal Detection
* **Purpose:** Establish baseline organizational health and identify early warning signs.
* **Tools:** KPI scorecards, aggregate metrics.
* **Key Questions:** Are revenue, yield, and demand signals aligned? Are there indicators of systemic drift?

### 2. Risk Localization
* **Purpose:** Identify where problems concentrate.
* **Tools:** Scatter plots (Yield vs Defect Rate), bubble sizing by production volume.
* **Key Questions:** Which products combine scale with elevated quality risk? Where will intervention have the greatest impact?

### 3. Capacity & Value Alignment
* **Purpose:** Evaluate whether production effort aligns with financial outcomes.
* **Tools:** Units Produced vs Revenue bar charts.
* **Key Questions:** Are high-volume products also high-value? Is capacity being consumed efficiently?

### 4. System Performance Validation
* **Purpose:** Confirm whether infrastructure or processes constrain output.
* **Tools:** Throughput vs Latency scatter plots.
* **Key Questions:** Are there bottlenecks limiting scalability? Is performance stable across products?

### 5. Operational Actionability
* **Purpose:** Enable immediate follow-up and root cause analysis.
* **Tools:** Product Performance Diagnostic Table.
* **Key Questions:** Which products should teams investigate first? What combination of metrics defines priority?
