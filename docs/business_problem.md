# Business Problem Statement

Advanced manufacturing organizations like AMD operate at massive scale, where small inefficiencies in forecasting accuracy, production yield, defect rates, or system performance can result in significant financial impact. While aggregate performance metrics may appear healthy, risk and inefficiency often concentrate at the product level, where they can remain hidden without structured analytics.

## The Core Business Challenge
How can leadership identify high-impact product risks early, prioritize corrective action, and align production capacity with revenue outcomes using reliable, scalable analytics?

### Key Challenges
* **Aggregate Metrics Mask Risk:** High-level KPIs (revenue, yield, demand accuracy) can conceal product-specific issues that materially affect cost, quality, and customer satisfaction.
* **Forecasting Drift Impacts Planning:** Even modest, persistent deviation between forecasted and actual demand can lead to inventory imbalances, production inefficiencies, and missed revenue opportunities.
* **Quality Risk Is Not Evenly Distributed:** Defects and yield losses tend to concentrate in a subset of products, particularly those produced at scale, amplifying their financial impact.
* **Operational Signals Are Fragmented:** Manufacturing quality, system performance, and revenue data often live in separate analytical silos, making it difficult to form a unified operational view.

### Business Objective
The objective of this project is to deliver an analytics-driven decision framework that enables:
* Early detection of product-level quality and performance risk.
* Clear prioritization of intervention based on financial and operational impact.
* Alignment between demand forecasting, production capacity, and revenue outcomes.
* Executive-level visibility supported by drill-down diagnostics.

This mirrors the role of a Data Analytics Engineer supporting cross-functional stakeholders across engineering, operations, and leadership.

### Success Criteria
The solution is considered successful if it:
1.  Surfaces product-level risks not visible in aggregate KPIs.
2.  Enables actionable prioritization without manual data blending.
3.  Maintains analytical accuracy and transparency.
4.  Scales cleanly through structured data modeling rather than ad-hoc dashboard logic.
